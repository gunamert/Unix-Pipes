# Unix-Pipes


the task was designing a program using Unix pipes in which one process sends a string message to a second process, and the second process randomly encrypts one character of the string and passes it to the second child process. 
The second child process also encrypts a random character within the string and sends it to the third child process that finally prints the string to the screen.
For example, if the first process sends the message “trythisstring”, the second process will return “tryThisstring” and third process will return “tryThis9tring”.
